# AP1 - Data Science Project

This repository contains starter files for the AP1 assignment in the Master Data Scientist course. It includes a minimal Python data-science project scaffold: a README, requirements, a `.vscode` settings file, a starter script under `src/`, and an empty Jupyter notebook under `notebooks/`.

How to use:
1. Open this folder in VS Code.
2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended).
3. Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
4. Open `notebooks/Starter.ipynb` to begin analysis.
